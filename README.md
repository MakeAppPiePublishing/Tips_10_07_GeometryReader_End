This was originally part of a cosplay of a Science fiction character.  To learn more about this cosplay and my experience, you can find that here http://www.sliceofapppie.com/2020/03/cosplay-coffee-and-story/

I was granted permission by author Nathan Lowell, who helped get this tabet working. I did need to give him and his books a shout out. You'll find allhis books on his Amazon author page here: https://www.amazon.com/Nathan-Lowell/e/B003D54RY4 

The story is not your regualar Science fiction story of Empires, dramatic space battles, and aliens. It starts as a slice of life story about a guy forced to take a job on a spacehip in a menial job, but grows over the novels to one about business in space from the freight hauler's point of view. Lowell has a magic about his prose that will make you excited about a cup of coffe and selling belts at a flea market.
